Hello, I'm Alex Rael and welcome to my Github pages. This will be a directory for the projects that I'm either working on, or have worked on. Links are below. I've spent 3 months taking the Java + Android bootcamp hosted by the CNM Stemulus center located at downtown Albuquerque, New Mexico. My main training and education for Java and Android development comes from that bootcamp. Click Here: https://deepdivecoding.com/java-android/ for more information on that bootcamp if you're interested.
