      <h3><strong>Qualitative vs Quanitative</strong></h3>  <BR>
   <p>Through my career I’ve spent most of my time servicing over 100 people per day in both guest services and a cashier for a hotel and cafeteria. I’ve handled, at most, up to $4000, in one day, in cash, checks, and or credit card transactions throughout my career with proper cash handling methods.  My communication was very effective to these customers, as I was very professional.. The problem I have is being too professional and sounding like a robot. I also have very good personable communication skills, which I used well with friends, co workers and management, and it was that quality that was missed out in my customer service. Before leaving my last job, my manager told me that my communication skills were great but faltered with the guests since I just sounded monotone.</p>

   <p>In customer service, resolving customer complaints is a big deal. No matter how good the product can be, there are still user issues for multiple aspects of the product that customers will complain on. At my previous workplace, a portion of my 100, or more, per day customer base would come to my co workers and I with their frustrations and complaints. It was up to us to understand the issues fully, and resolve them the best we can. Proper training was given for certain issues, but people are unpredictable, and knowing the answer for the complaint doesn't mean it's the right answer for the customer. I was very good at resolving issues, but my biggest problem was actually listening fully, and understanding what it was people actually wanted, (free stuff.)</p>

   <p>While I worked at the cafeteria, servicing at least 100 students a day, I tried my best to make it a habit to do extra work. Most of the workers in that building were either cleaning, cooking or serving food. I stood at the cash register logging people who enter, by either cross checking ID's or money exchange. That feeling like I should be working to the same extent as everyone else killed me. I did my best to clean up counters, get fruit out, replinish cups, but in the end I overworked myself, and never felt confident.</p><BR>

   <h3><strong>Passion Project</strong></h3><BR>
   <p>My generation was brought up by computers. Computers have always been a large part of my life and I’ve even custom built my personal computer. Going through school and getting my Hospitality and Tourism degree, I was convinced that this path would be that of my dreams. In reality, I always had this thought that I wanted to work in computer hardware or software. Went through with my degree anyway, got a job or two, even a volunteering gig, and after a few years, decided that I just didn’t like it. At this point, having used a computer everyday, I finally came up with the idea to get into the development industry. Actually, I spent some time first trying to get another job in sales, which, obviously, did not work out. The thought process of having to go back to school and learn to become a developer de-motivated me. I didn’t want to do it, and was too lazy to do it. Development was a work type I really wanted to pursue, but I just didn’t want to take the time to figure it all out. I wanted to get a sales job, and teach myself some language as I lived on. The thought process of learning a language kept me from actually learning the language. I finally decided to commit, and now I'm here 9/26/2018 taking the Java bootcamp through CNM. Finally enacting my passion for computers through learning the Java programming language, and eventually taking off my switched career path once finished.</p><BR>

   <h3><strong>Golden Circle</strong></h3><BR>
   <p><br><strong>Why:</strong><br> To help make people’s lives easier<br>

   <h3><strong>Elevator Pitch</strong></h3><BR>
   <p>Hello, I'm Alex. I am a software and app developer. I have a purpose to make people's lives easier with the use of their personal devices through such software and apps. I'd be happy to explain further if you'd like, here's my business. Have a wonderful day!</p><BR>

<h2><strong> Week 1 of Weekly Reflections</strong> </h2><BR>
  <p> The beginning of week 1 was pretty rough. Seeing java in it's full form was very intimidating. Going through it all and taking the time to understand things (still struggling to understand) was pretty exhausting. Of course, now being day 5 of the week, I can safely say that, compared to day 1, everything makes a lot more sense. Nick is a good instructor and is pretty articulate in what he says. The reading also helped bring more understanding to what it was we were all doing. Looking forward to doing more,</p>

<h3><strong>Organization Research</strong></h3><BR>
  <p><strong>1. Visit Albuquerque (not-for-profit)</strong>
  <ul><li>Contact: Roxanne Cisneros</li>
    <li>Contact info: cisneros@visitalbuquerque.org,  505-842-9918 ext. 3304</li>
    <li><a href="http://visitalbuquerque.org" target="_blank">A link to their website</a></li>
    <li>I use to volunteer for this organization. I also use to keep an eye on their employment opportunities since at the time I was passionate about the tourism industry in Albuquerque. Roxanne was the volunteer coordinator, who I got to know pretty well, and I just found out recently that she is still the volunteer coordinator.</li>
    <li>Reach to Roxanne via phone or email in an attempt to retrieve contact information for HR, or maybe to their own developers to speak with.</li></ul></p><BR>
  <p><strong>2. Amore Pizzeria (for profit)</strong>
  <ul><li>Contact: Gabriel Amador</li>
    <li>Contact info: info@amoreabq.com</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.amoreabq.com/" target="_blank">A link to their website</a></li>
   <li>I was thinking about reaching out to a local restaurant and see if I can offer assistance in the creation of some sort rewards program they could offer to their customers. All the point systems and user account information would have to be stored server which I'd be happy to help them maintain. Possibly also develop an Amore app.</li>
   <li>Would contact Gabriel directly, explain my thought process to him and see how he reacts, or maybe get him to share some of ideas similar to the subject.</li></ul></p><BR>

<h2><strong>Week 2 Reflections</strong></h2><br>
<p>Week 2 was still pretty exhausting, but not as bad as week 1. Getting use to waking up in the morning kind of. Compared to week 1, things are starting to make more sense, but still got a lot to learn. The curriculum is great, and I like the idea of spending time out of class understanding what we just saw. Our first quiz was this week, which went well. I belive it took me 3 trys to get a 90%, which was alright, but the big test is in 2 weeks. I'm confident I'll do better then. This week we also started talking more about projects.go that to decide sometime this weekend. Other than all that, everything has been well.</p>
